Warm welcomes.

After more than a handful of failed attempts to start blogging, I’ve built up enough courage to start writing, and I’m thrilled that [*untitld*](/) has seen the light of day.

Reasons for failure were manifold, among them being an unforgiving academic schedule. The kind that forbids one from partaking in extracurricular activities without worrying about losing time. But perhaps the most relevant to this blog was failure to find a motif for *untitld*. I gave a lot of thought about the objectives of *untitld*, attempting to narrow down possible topics of departure from "Ground Zero" proved to be rather unfruitful and tiresome. I gave up altogether. However, this would later come up again in conversation with a friend. 

At some point during the conversation, I told my friend that I would be blogging soon. They paused and proceeded to ask "What will the blog be about?". To their dismay, they were met with an eerie silence. "I thought blogs are supposed to have a theme’, they continued. Alas, for my friend and those that share the same views will be disappointed to hear that, this site will only fulfill the role of a core dump where I occasionally write, whenever and about whatever I please. I prefer this over what my friend was insinuating as the latter implies an agenda which goes against the eventual ethos of *untitld*.

*untitld* is still a work in progress with a lot of moving parts. As time goes on, I will include a comment section at the end of every subsequent blog post for feedback.

Thank you for being here. Until the next blog post.

Yours truly,

Unathi
