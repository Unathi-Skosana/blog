Hi, I am Unathi.

I'm a Masters physics student with research interests in quantum information science at Stellenbosch University. In 2019, I completed my Honours degree in physics at the aforementioned university.

My [primary research interests](/academia) are centered around quantum optics which involves the study of quantum properties of light and the applications to
NISQy quantum computing and quantum communication. I'm currently part of the quantum photonics group in the physics department of Stellenbosch University spearheaded by [Professor Mark Tame](http://quantumnanophotonics.org/).

Aside from my research, I enjoy learning about topics in mathematics and computer science such as graph theory, statistics and probability theory, group theory and their applications to physics. My free time is well spent actively trying to fit the entirety of [Nielsen & Chuang](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Quantum-Computation-Information-10th-Anniversary/dp/1107002176/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=nielsen+and+chuang&qid=1565567488&s=books&sr=1-1), into my head. Apart from this fruitful exercise I also enjoy [reading](/misc/#booksessays), listening to [podcasts](/misc/#podcasts), skateboarding, occasionally practice playing saxophone and guitar and tutoring freshmen and sophomore physics students.

If you ever have any concerns, comments, questions, or suggestions please feel free to reach out through any of the methods listed on my [home](/) page.
